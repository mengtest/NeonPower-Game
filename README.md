Unity3D Lethal-League Like Game


A Lethal-League Clone created in Unity3D by Terry Nguyen & Kuong-Iy Seng

This game was created for a unit (Video Games Development) in our university (University of Western Sydney).

It took us around 8-10 weeks for us to create the game. It came first place for our unit and we're proud of what we achieved for a short
amount of time and the very first time for us developing a game.


This is the first time that we're using github and people can peer on what we did for our game and see some of our amateur mistakes.

There aren't many tutorials or resources that we could find that have similar playing mechanics like ours so this is for the people
who are trying to make a fighting game or a another lethal league like game.
